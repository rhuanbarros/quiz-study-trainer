      content: "# 📚 Machine Learning Interview Preparation Quiz Trainer \n\nA better alternative to flashcards!\n\n## 🚀 Problem Addressed\nI have needed to study some topics in machine learning, but I haven’t found any good specific quizzes about them. \n\nI have also tried studying with some flashcard apps, but it didn’t work because I had to create the flashcards, and I found it boring because the flashcards didn’t have any kind of provocative appeal, like questions would have. \n\nAdditionally, I want to keep track of the content I study and how many questions I get right and wrong. Therefore, I need a custom UI and fine-grained questions.\n\n## 💡 Solution\nI could just ask ChatGPT to create the questions, but it got very repetitive. I realized that if I prompted it with a piece of text about the subject matter, it would create much better questions. So, I created a very customized prompts for this task.\n\n## Frontend (and backend)\n- I have used the Anvil framework to create the frontend. Previously, I used Streamlit, but I changed because of the platform's limitations and the difficulty of creating multipage apps. Also, I would like to continue practicing writing Python code, so Anvil seems to be a good option.\n- There is a feature that, when I don't know the answer, I can click a button, and it automatically queries the LLM model to explain the topic for me. This way, I don't need to leave the app and can continue the study session seamlessly.\n- I also wanted to keep track of my results over time, so there is a page to show a study report.\n\n## Community development\nI created this project to enable development with anyone who needs a similar solution. Therefore, we can create new features quickly. All pull requests are welcome.\n\n[Take a look at this page to know how to open this project using Anvil Cloud.](ANVIL_README.MD)\n\n\n## Online version hosted\nYou can access a free online version of this app hosted on Anvil Cloud at https://ill-informed-careless-panther.anvil.app/\n\n\n## Key Points\n- 🐍 **Python**: Completely coded in Python using the Anvil framework (frontend and backend).\n- 🧠 **Prompt engeneering**: Customized prompt for better question creation.\n- 📈 **Enhanced Learning**: Improves memorization of concepts similiar to Spaced Repetion techinique.\n- 📚 **Integrated Knowledge**: Query LLM model directly for explanations without leaving the app.\n- 🗂️ **Result Tracking**: Keep track of study progress and quiz results over time.\n- ☁️ **Cloud Accessibility**: Hosted in the cloud for access on mobile devices.\n"
