Explanation

Correct answer

The correct answer is option 4: data obtained through a social media platform's API. This is because primary data sources directly provide raw, firsthand data. In the context of studying the effects of social media on mental health, data obtained directly from a social media platform via its API consists of original, unprocessed information such as user interactions, posts, and behavioral data. This type of data is most suitable for an analysis that aims to explore new insights and conduct an original research study, as it has not been filtered or interpreted through secondary analysis like the other options listed.

You selected "I don't know yet" or didn't select an option.

Correct answer

Moving averages are primarily used to estimate the trend of time-series data. This means that they help smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term patterns or trends, making it easier to see the underlying direction of the data over time. This is why option 2 is correct. Options 1 and 3 are somewhat related but donâ€™t capture the main purpose of moving averages, which is trend estimation, while option 4 is incorrect because moving averages are not typically used to model seasonal components.

Explanation

What you selected

The option you selected, click-through rate (CTR), primarily measures how often people click on the link provided in the campaign relative to the number of times the ad is shown. Although CTR is important for understanding how appealing or effective the ad is at generating clicks, it does not directly measure the level of user interaction or engagement with the content, which is more relevant to brand awareness goals. CTR is more aligned with initial interest rather than deeper engagement metrics.

Correct answer

The correct answer, engagement rate, is the best KPI for measuring the success of a social media campaign aimed at increasing brand awareness. Engagement rate includes metrics such as likes, shares, comments, and other interactions that indicate how actively involved the audience is with the content. This level of interaction is a direct indicator of how much the audience resonates with the message, which is crucial for building brand awareness. By analyzing engagement, the company can better understand how effectively the campaign is capturing and holding the audience's attention.

Explanation

What you selected

Your selection of using a union operation on both datasets is incorrect. A union operation combines all the records from both datasets and removes duplicates. However, it doesn't combine the 'Sales Amount' for the same 'Product ID', which is the requirement in this case. The options of merging datasets using left join on 'Product ID' and 'Category' or performing an inner join on 'Product ID' and 'Category' would also not meet the requirement. A left join includes all records from the left dataset and matching records from the right dataset, while an inner join only includes records that have matching values in both datasets. Neither operation aggregates the 'Sales Amount' for the same 'Product ID'.

Correct answer

The correct option is to apply a full outer join on 'Product ID' with a condition to aggregate 'Sales Amount'. This operation would include all records from both datasets, and for those records with the same 'Product ID', the 'Sales Amounts' from both stores would be combined. When it comes to merging datasets and combining specific column values, a full outer join with an aggregation condition is the most appropriate set operation. Remember, it's crucial to consider the specific requirements of the data manipulation task to choose the right operation.

Correct answer

The choice of Stratified K-Fold cross-validation is indeed the most appropriate for your scenario involving an imbalanced multi-class dataset. The advantage of Stratified K-Fold is that it ensures each fold of the dataset contains approximately the same percentage of samples of each class as the complete set. This is particularly important in your case because it helps in maintaining a representative mix of the classes, thereby providing a more accurate measure of the model's performance on unseen data. It prevents the model from being biased towards the majority class and improves the reliability of the evaluation, especially in medical diagnosis systems where the balance of sensitivity among classes can be crucial.

Explanation

What you selected

The selection you made, "The distribution of age in the dataset changes over time," refers to a change in the population characteristics rather than a fundamental shift in the underlying concept that the model was initially designed to predict. While changing demographics can affect model performance, concept drift specifically relates to changes in the relationships between input features and the target variable, not just changes in the features themselves.

Correct answer

The correct answer, "The definition of bad loans changes," is an example of concept drift because it indicates a shift in the criteria used to define the outcome variable the model is predicting. When the definition of what constitutes a bad loan changes, the historical data the model was trained on no longer represents the same target concept, leading to potential decreases in model accuracy and effectiveness until the model is retrained or adjusted to reflect this new definition.

Question 8 of 11
Back to Domain Score
Previous Question
Next Question
Explanation

What you selected

The approach of using a fixed threshold based on standard deviation from the mean to classify outliers, as mentioned in your selection, can be too rigid for complex datasets. This method assumes that data follows a normal distribution, which might not be the case in many real-world scenarios. It also doesn't account for the possibility that what appears to be outliers could be valid extreme values, significant for the analysis. Hence, this method could lead to incorrect exclusion of important data or failure to detect actual outliers in non-normal distributions.

Correct answer

The correct method involves using unsupervised machine learning algorithms like DBSCAN or LOF to identify outliers. These algorithms are effective because they do not rely on assumptions about the data distribution and can adapt to the data's actual structure. DBSCAN, for example, clusters data points based on density, effectively isolating sparse points as outliers. LOF measures the local deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbors, which helps in identifying points that substantially deviate from typical data patterns. This flexibility makes them ideal for handling complex and large datasets with potential outliers.

Correct answer

To find the confidence interval for the mean weight of apples, we use the formula: mean Â± (z-value * (standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))). Here, the mean is 150 grams, the z-value is 1.96, the standard deviation is 10 grams, and the sample size is 81. Plugging in these values gives us 150 Â± (1.96 * (10 / sqrt(81))), which simplifies to 150 Â± (1.96 * 1.11). This calculation results in the interval 150 Â± 2.18, or [147.82, 152.18], which matches option 4. This interval is where we expect the true mean weight of the apples to lie with 95% confidence.

Explanation

What you selected

The option to compute the correlation coefficient between weather conditions and injury severity is incorrect because the correlation coefficient is typically used for measuring the strength of a linear relationship between two continuous variables. Here, both weather conditions and injury severity are likely categorical variables (e.g., weather conditions might be labeled as 'rainy', 'sunny', etc., and injury severity as 'low', 'medium', 'high'). The correlation coefficient is not suitable for analyzing relationships between categorical variables.

Correct answer

Creating a contingency table for weather conditions and injury severity is the correct choice because it allows you to examine the frequency distribution of injury severity across different weather conditions. This method is particularly useful for categorical variables, enabling an analysis of how these categories interact or are associated with each other. By observing this table, patterns or trends in injury severity relative to different weather conditions can be identified, which is helpful for understanding their relationship without resorting to graphical methods.

Explanation
The correct answer to the question is Spearman's rank correlation analysis (which you selected).

Here's why:

Pearson's correlation analysis measures the linear relationship between two variables. In the scatter plot shown, the relationship between x and y appears to be non-linear (likely a quadratic or exponential relationship).

Spearman's rank correlation analysis is a non-parametric measure that assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described by a monotonic function (whether increasing or decreasing). It is more appropriate when the relationship is non-linear, as in this case.

The Chi-Squared test is used for categorical data, and the Fisher correlation coefficient is not typically used for correlation analysis in this context.

MemÃ³ria atualizada
Yes, that's correct! The main difference between Pearson and Spearman correlation is how they handle the relationship between variables:

Pearson's correlation assumes a linear relationship between variables. It measures the strength and direction of a linear association.

Spearman's rank correlation does not assume a linear relationship. It assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described by a monotonic function (where one variable consistently increases or decreases as the other does, though not necessarily at a constant rate).

In this case, the relationship between x and y in the scatter plot is non-linear but appears monotonic, so Spearman's method is the most appropriate.

Explanation

Correct answer

In K-fold cross-validation, choosing a lower value of K, such as K = 2, generally results in a lower computational cost. This is because the dataset is divided into fewer folds, and each fold is used fewer times as the validation set throughout the cross-validation process. With K = 2, the dataset is split into two parts: one part is used for training and the other for validation. This setup requires fewer training iterations compared to higher values of K, such as K = 10 or K = m, where m is the total number of training examples. Therefore, by choosing K = 2, the process is less computationally intensive as it involves fewer splits and less repetitive training, making it a more efficient choice when computational resources are a concern.

What you selected

Option 2 is incorrect because strong learners usually have lower bias and higher variance, whereas weak learners tend to have higher bias and lower variance. Bias and variance are crucial concepts in understanding the behavior of different models. Strong learners, with their complexity, can capture the patterns in the data more accurately but may also capture noise, leading to higher variance. Weak learners are simpler and may not capture all the patterns, thus having higher bias but lower variance.

Correct answer

Option 1 is correct because strong learners do generalize better to unseen data, whereas weak learners tend to underfit. Strong learners are typically more complex models that can capture intricate patterns in data, allowing them to perform well on both training and unseen data. In contrast, weak learners are simpler models that may not capture all the patterns in the data, resulting in underfitting and poor generalization to new data.

Answer is partially correct

The response identifies a potential source of bias, specifically the skewed representation of ethnic groups in the dataset. It also suggests a method to address this bias by gathering faces from a broader range of ethnicities and ensuring balanced data representation. However, the explanation lacks technical terminology and comprehensive detail on how to implement these measures effectively, such as using specific algorithms to detect and correct biases.


Better answer:
A potential source of bias in facial recognition models is an unbalanced representation of ethnic groups in the training data. To address this, I would ensure the dataset includes diverse ethnic groups, considering variations within ethnicities across regions. Additionally, I would apply techniques like re-sampling or weighted loss functions to balance underrepresented groups. Bias detection algorithms, such as fairness metrics (e.g., Demographic Parity), could also be employed to monitor and mitigate bias throughout training.

What you selected

The selection of Scenario 2 as the most appropriate for gradient boosting was incorrect mainly because the training and validation errors suggest a different pattern of model behavior. In Scenario 2, the training error is relatively low (45), and the validation error is higher (95), indicating potential overfitting with a maximum depth of 9. Gradient boosting generally benefits from scenarios where additional complexity (in this case, deeper trees) could improve performance on both training and validation datasets without leading to significant overfitting.

Correct answer

The correct choice is Scenario 4, and here's why: the training error is moderately high (70), and the validation error is also high (95). This suggests that the model with a max depth of 4 is underfitting, which means it is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data effectively. Gradient boosting improves performance by sequentially adding new models that address the residual errors made by existing models, making it particularly suitable for scenarios where increasing model complexity can lead to significant gains in performance.

You selected "I don't know yet" or didn't select an option.

Correct answer

Ridge regression, also known as Tikhonov regularization, is particularly effective in datasets where there is high collinearity between features because it includes a penalty for large coefficients, which helps to reduce their variance. Unlike Lasso regression, which can produce sparse models (some coefficients exactly zero), Ridge regression does not typically result in sparse models, even with low regularization parameter values. This is why the correct answers are (A) high and (B) wonâ€™t.
